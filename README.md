Program Management Module (PMM) is a standard framework that connects all program delivery tools across our nonprofit ecosystem. The framework outlines a standard data architecture that will make it easier for nonprofits to centralize and connect the tools they are using to manage the core of what they do—program delivery. PMM was created to be general enough to reflect the wide variety of programs nonprofits are delivering, whether working with clients or running an environmental advocacy program. It is free, open source, and, although a separate package, it serves as an extension of Salesforce.org’s Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP).
